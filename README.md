![Unit Tests](https://github.com/jbrower95/eigenblob/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)

EigenBlob is a convenience library that wraps [EigenDA](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda) for usage
in web and server applications.

## Installation

`npm install @jbrower95/eigenblob`

## Sample Usage

```typescript
const client = new EigenDA(); // defaults to testnet

// you can `.put()` any JS object that is serializable.
const resp = await client.put({hello: 'world'});

// you can use the `resp.id` to fetch this item back from anywhere.
const blob = await client.get<any>(resp.id);

expect(blob.hello).toEqual('world');
```

## Under the hood

- `EigenBlob` uses `CompressionStream` to gzip encode your object after JSON encoding it.
- `EigenBlob` handles polling for different intermediate states and making sure that your blob is successfully added to the network
before returning.

## Constraints

- Blobs can't be more than 2MB in size.
- Blobs exist for 14 days on the network.
- Testnet's free tier is limited to 1.28 kb/s. ([source](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenda-updated-pricing/)).
- For mainnet, you can contact Eigen for access. ([source](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXvfxgRfIHWYu90FqN-2yyhgrYm9oExr0jSy7ERzbMUimJew/viewform))
